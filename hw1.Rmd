```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. `hw1.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

    ```
    ds202_hw1
    |-- hw1.Rmd
    |-- hw1.html (generated after knitting)
    ```
    
    **Done**

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    **Done**

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    Hello! My name is **Ryan Pate** and I'm a senior majoring in *Animal Ecology* and *Biology*. I was born in Houston, Texas and I grew up in southeast Iowa. I have a dog, a rat, and a tarantula. In my freetime I like playing video games, hanging out with friends, spending time with my dog, and birding. I'm currently working on campus in a lab where I rear monarch butterflies for the USDA and for use in graduate research.
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    A job I think is related to data science is a wildlife biologist! A large part of the job of a wildlife biologist (depending on the field of study and position) is collecting data and performing complex data analyses. Click [here](https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wsb.570) to view an editoral article from *The Wildlife Society* about the importance of data management in wildlife conservation. Below is an image of me (a future wildlife biologist) working in the field, collecting data on insects in western Montana.

5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.

    Since it is most relevant to my field, I will be the most interested in working with wildlife and ecology datasets. For example, I recently worked with a massive dataset regarding camera trap data for a country-wide project on species presence based on camera trap data collected by one person in each state over a certain period of time.
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code trunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

```{r}
version
```
  
7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    **Done**
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    **My version of Git is 2.20.1 (Apple Git-117)**
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "your first and last name"
    git config --global user.email "yourEmail"
    ```

    **Done**
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?
